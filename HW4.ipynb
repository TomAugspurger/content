      "\n",
      "In this homework, you will create a recommendation system for **restaurants** using [collaborative filtering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) (CF). The general structure of a recommendation system is that there are users and there are items. Users express explicit or implicit preferences towards certain items. CF thus relies on users' past behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two primary approaches to CF: neighboorhood and latent factor model. The former is concerned with computing the relationships between items or between users. In the latter approach you have a model of hidden factors through which users and items are transformed to the same space. For example, if you are rating movies we may transform items into genre factors, and users into their preference for a particular genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Factor models generally lead to more accurate recommenders. One of the reasons for this is the sparsity of the item-user matrix. Most users tend to rate barely one or two items. Latent factor models are more expressive, and fit fewer parameters. However, neighborhood models are more prevalent, as they have an intuitive aspect that appeals to users(if you liked this you will like that) and online(a new preference can be incorporated very quickly).\n",
      "\n",
      "Most recommenders today combine neighboorhood CF with model based CF, and SVD based matrix factorization approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "To see the example of a simple beer recommender, go [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/20a18d52c539b87de2af). This homework is inspired by the one there but we go after food instead, and go deeper into the problem of making recommendations."

      "### User and Item based approaches\n",
      "\n",
      "Original approaches to neighborhood based CF used user-user models. By this we mean that rating estimates are made from recorded ratings of like minded users. However, since most users tend to rate very few items, this is usually a losing proposition for explicit-rating based recommenders. Thus, most neighborhood based systems such as Amazon these days rely on item-item approaches. In these methods, a rating is estimated by other ratings made by the user on \"similar\" or \"nearby\" items: we have a K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm, in effect."

      "\n",
      "The outline of this homework is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Create a database of item-item similarities. Use this to implement a neighborhood-based CF recommender that can answer simple questions like \"give me more restaurants like this one\". This part of the homework assumes that the similaties calculated make good \"global recommendations\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In the second part, we go one step further and attempt to predict the rating that a user will give an item they have not seen before. This requires that we find the restaurants that *this* user would rate as similar (not just those which are globally similar). \n",
      "\n",
      "3. In the third part, we implement a factor-based CF recommender using a Bayesian model. While quite a bit more complex, this allows us to pool information both about similar users and about similar restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. We will scale up our system by creating a recommender on the lines of Q1 and Q2 that works on the entire data set. We will use the map-reduce paradigm to split the computation over multiple machines."

You will create this  smaller set by taking all the users who had rated more than 60 restaurants, and all the businesses which had greater than 150 reviews from the larger data set. This is not a random set: indeed we use it as it a computationally tractable set that is a bit less sparse than the entire data set."

      "\n",
      "To motivate our recommendation system, consider the follwing example. Let's pretend we are in Boston for a second. Lets say the average rating of restaurants here by all the users is 3.5. Sandrine's at Harvard square is better than an average restaurant, so it tends to be rated 0.5 stars above the average (over all the users). However, you are a curmudgeon, who tends to rate 0.2 stars below the average. Then a baseline estimate for the recommendation for Sandrine's, for you, is 3.5+0.5-0.2=3.8.\n",
      "\n",
      "These baseline estimates thus adjust the data by accounting for the systematic tendencies for some users who give higher ratings than others, and for some restaurants to recieve higher ratings than others. We can write the baseline estimate $\\hat Y_{um}^{baseline}$ for an unknown rating $Y_{um}$ for user $u$ and restaurant or business $m$ as:\n",

      "$$ \\hat Y_{um}^{baseline} = \\hat \\mu + \\hat \\theta_{u0} + \\hat \\gamma_{m0} $$\n",

      "\n",
      "Notice that the $\\theta_{u0}$ and $\\gamma_{m0}$ are parameters which need to be fit. The simplest thing to start with, and something we will do for Problems 1 and 2 (but not 3), is to replace them by their \"mean\" estimates from the data. Thus:\n",

      "\n",
      "The final two terms correspond to the user-specific and item-specific bias in ratings, that is, how their ratings tend to systematically diverge from the global average. This is the simplest possible way to predict a rating, based only on information about *this* user and *this* restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can we do a better job of predicting the rating $Y_{um}$ user $u$ would give to restaurant $r$? According to the central dogma of CF, we ought to be able to use the responses of *similar* users regarding *similar* restaurants to get a better prediction. \n",

Here we shall use the Pearson coefficient. This measures the tendency of users to rate items similarly.

      "Now we have a way to pool information between similar restaurants to try to predict a user's recommendation. But how do we choose the neighborhood to pool over? We begin with the simplest choice. We calculate the similarity between items using their entire common user support, and rank the nearest neighbors of an item by this similarity. We call this a \"global\" recommender because it assumes that every user perceives the similarity between restaurants in the same way. Later on, we will implement a more specific recommender that pools information based on which items seem the most similar *to this user*.\n",
      "\n",
      "The global recommender does have the advantage of dealing with the possible sparsity of the user's rated items, but also the disadvantage of giving one answer for all users, without taking the user's preferences into account. This is a classic case of bias-variance tradeoff.\n",

      "####A Note on Frequentist and Bayesian Procedures\n",
      "\n",
      "In the previous section we implemented a **procedure** (a set of instructions for processing data) for giving recommendations and predicting user ratings for restaurants. This procedure involved a number of arbitrary choices -- for example, the particular measure of similarity between restaurants, or the weighting scheme for constructing a predicted rating. It also gave no sense of uncertainty -- in the case of giving recommendations, there was no statement about how we would expect the ranking from the procedure to compare to the user's true opinions of restaurants, and in the case of predicting ratings, there was no confidence interval for the prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible in repeated applications of the above procedure to see how it performs in the long run. Based on this long-run performance we could potentially justify certain functional choices and compute measurements of uncertainty. This framework of proposing a procedure first, then evaluating its performance in real or hypothetical replications of the experiment is an example of a *frequentist* approach to a problem. One aspect of the frequentist approach is that the proposed procedure does not necessarily have to be derived from a model (although it often is). While this means that a proposed procedure may be more flexible or robust than a model-based procedure, it also means that there is no natural way to justify certain functional choices or construct uncertainty estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, the *Bayesian* approach to a problem always begins with a **probablistic model** for how the data were generated. Assuming this model is true, the posterior distribution over unknown quantities (either parameters to be estimated or unobserved data to be predicted) gives a single coherent expression of what the observed data tell us about the unknowns. By summarizing the posterior distribution, we can derive the exact functional form of a procedure for constructing estimates or predictions. We call a procedure derived from this Bayesian approach a **Bayes rule** (not to be confused with Bayes' Theorem). Using the posterior distribution, we can also give a sense of how uncertain we are about the estimate or prediction we have constructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "####Outline for this Problem\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section, we construct a **model** of how ratings are generated, and use this model to build a recommendation and ratings prediction system. We will take a Bayesian approach here, and construct our estimates and predictions from summaries of the *posterior distribution* of the model's parameters, which we will compute using a *Gibbs sampler*. We will also give measures of uncertainty based on the posterior distribution. We will evaluate predictions from this approach in the same way we evalutated predictions from the KNN procedure above."

      "###The Latent Factor Model###\n",
      "\n",
      "####Model Overview####\n",
      "\n",
      "The central dogma in constructing a recommendation system using collaborative filtering is that *similar users will rate similar restaurants similarly*. In the previous section, we explicitly encoded this idea by using a similarity function to identify similar restaurants. We also assumed that either all users were the same (the global approach) or that only the current user was similar enough to make a recommendation (the user-specific approach). In this section, we will use a model that allows us to identify both similar users and similar restaurants as a function of **latent factors**.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can think of latent factors as properties of restaurants (e.g., spiciness of food or price) that users have a positive or negative preference for. We do not observe these factors or the users' preferences directly, but we assume that they affect how users tend to rate restaurants. For example, if a restaurant serves a lot of spicy food and a user dislikes spicy food, then the restaurant would have a high \"spiciness\" factor, and the user would have a strongly negative preference, resulting in a prediction of a low rating. Note that if users have similar preferences, then according to the model, they will behave similarly, and likewise, if restaurants have similar latent factors, they will be rated similarly by similar users. Latent factors thus give us an intuitive way to specify a generative model the obeys the central dogma.\n",
      "\n",
      "One issue that comes up with latent factor models is determining how many latent factors to include. There may be a number of different unmeasured properties that affect ratings in different ways -- for example, in addition to the spiciness factor above, there may also be a price factor that affects how users rate a restaurant. We deal with the problem of choosing the number of latent factors to include in the same way we deal with choosing $K$ in a $K$-nearest neighbors problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "####Rating Model Specification####\n",
      "\n",
      "To make this model concrete, we can write down our probability model as a generative process. First, we define the following quantities:\n",

To submit your homework, create a folder named lastname_firstinitial_hw4 and place your solutions in the folder. Double check that the file is still called HW4.ipynb, and that it contains your code. Also include the `computesim.py` script and the `output.small.local.txt` data file. Do **NOT** include the data file `output.full.emr.txt` from the larger run (its huge, so we will check your answers to 4.4 instead). Compress the folder (please use .zip compression) and submit to the CS109 dropbox in the appropriate folder.
